### Min Coin With Plan

PseudoCode
```
for all types of denomination:
    from 1 to the target amount:
        check if current amount we are looking at is bigger than the denomination if we subtract the current denomination from the current amount, there is an existing solution to the remainder. this ensures that if we use this denom, we can still get an answer. if we wont, we do not even bother with it.
            if the above is true, for all the possible plans (ways) we can make up the remainder:
                we check if the number of coins in the plan exceeds the total quantity we have for this denom we are considering
                    if it is lesser, we check if the target amount has no plan yet or if the remainder 
```
**Errenous Error Below For Min Coin with Plan **
```
if min_coin_with_plan[j] is None or min_coin_with_plan[j - denom[i][0]].num_coin + 1 < min_coin_with_plan[j].num_coin: # must check if there is enough supply of denom[i][0]
```

This line here is comparing if the **total number of coins** used to make up the remainder after the current considered denomination `denom[i][0]` is subtracted from target sum `j`, incremented by 1 to signify adding the current `denom[i][0]` to the plan is LESSER than that of the number of coins used to make up the target `j`.

Instead, this should check if in the previous plan considered, the quantity of the current denominaton considered + 1 is does not exceed the available supply of the denomination.

> Question: Can array min_coin_num_only be changed to a 1-dimensional array?

No, the array used to solve this cannot be changed to a 1-dimensional array. There are two factors to take note of, the quantity as well as the value of the denominations. This will require minimally a 2-dimensional array to account for both factors accordingly.

**Q3**.

Initially, the counter example I was going for was to sum all up the total possible sum from the denomination and then add +1 to it. The error I was expecting to return was that the program would not be able to handle this case and crash instead of returning a -1 to indiate.

However, I noticed that for some reason,
* min_num_with_plan stopped at 6005 which was very peculiar
* min_num_only was able to get the correct answer of 143 (aka all the coins.)
