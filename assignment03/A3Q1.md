### Details
Things to modify from algorithm given in slides
1. Define a transformation that changes the probability of getting caught into a log probability, where a lower number corrosponds to the safest path (aka highest probability that he will not get caught.) Apply this transformation when creating the adjlist.
2. Modify the algorithm that keeps track of the shortest parent to any of the vertexes.
3. Define a function that given a start and end point, will traverse the information obtained in `2.` and return the shortest path.
4. Under custom Heap class created, modifed `Heap.update` such that if the arguments passed in indicate a shorter path, it will return `True` and `False` otherwise. This aids in updating `2.`.

# 1. Transformation
```
def transform_w(w: float) -> float:
    """
    Applies two set of transformation in the order below
    1. take 1 - w, this is to return a value of the probability of NOT being caught
    2. take natural log of the result from step 1, this is to convert it to log probabilities
    3. multiply by -1, this is to make the log probabilities positive
    This allows us to easily calculate the log probabilities of the path by summing the weights
    up. This particular transformation makes it so the smallest weight corrosponds to the lowest
    probability of being caught.
    """
    return -math.log(1 - w)
...
# Changed 
for u, v, w in wg:
    adjlist[u].append((v, transform_w(w)))
    adjlist[v].append((u, transform_w(w)))
```

# 3. Trace Path
```
def trace_path(start, end, shortest_parent):
    """
    Traces the path from the start to the end using the shortest_parent dictionary
    """
    path = []
    current = end
    while current != start:
        print(f"Current is {current} and start is {start}")
        path.append(current)
        current = shortest_parent[current][0]
    path.append(start)
    return path[::-1]

# Q1b
> Assumption: Each edge now has a value representing the probability of being caught `p(u,v)` as well as a time it takes to traverse the edge `t(u,v)`.

In order to fulfill the timing constraint `Tmax`, we first convert this into a `Max Flow` problem with some modification. The first modification is to add an **additional constraint that each flow must be maximal** and we modify the code to keep track of the traversal path when it is discovering the augmenting paths. We add a Source node with infinite supply and a `Sink` node that extends from the goal node (with the helicopter) with `Tmax` as its edge weight. For all the other edges in this graph, we initialize them with the time it takes to traverse that edge. We use `Ford-Fulkerson` algorithm to identify all the augmenting paths that Tom can possibly take. Paths that exceed the `Tmax` constraint will not be discovered.

Similar to the above, we perform the same transformation to all edges of  `-math.log(1 - w)`. This allows us to sum up all the paths individually, and from there we can return the path with the least score. This path will be a path that satisfies the timing constraint as well as being the safest.
